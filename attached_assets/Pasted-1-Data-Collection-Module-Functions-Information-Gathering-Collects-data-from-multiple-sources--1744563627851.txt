1. Data Collection Module
Functions:

Information Gathering: Collects data from multiple sources (e.g., field reports, social media, news, sensors, community informants).

Structured Surveys: Uses standardized forms to capture incident reports.

Automated Feeds: Integrates real-time data from satellites, drones, or IoT devices.

Community Engagement: Involves local stakeholders in reporting risks.

2. Data Processing & Analysis Module
Functions:

Data Cleaning: Filters out irrelevant or duplicate information.

Risk Indicators: Tracks key metrics (e.g., hate speech, displacement, arms movement).

Trend Analysis: Uses statistical models to identify patterns.

Machine Learning/AI: Predicts potential conflict hotspots based on historical data.

3. Risk Assessment & Alert Generation Module
Functions:

Threshold Monitoring: Flags anomalies when indicators exceed predefined levels.

Risk Scoring: Assigns severity levels (e.g., low, medium, high).

Automated Alerts: Sends notifications to relevant stakeholders (SMS, email, dashboards).

Scenario Modeling: Simulates potential escalation pathways.

4. Communication & Dissemination Module
Functions:

Multi-Channel Alerts: Distributes warnings via SMS, apps, radio, or social media.

Stakeholder Mapping: Identifies who needs to receive alerts (government, NGOs, communities).

Secure Channels: Ensures encrypted communication for sensitive data.

5. Response Coordination Module
Functions:

Response Plans: Predefined protocols for different risk levels.

Task Assignment: Allocates roles to response teams.

Resource Mobilization: Tracks available assets (e.g., peacekeepers, aid supplies).

Inter-Agency Coordination: Facilitates collaboration among NGOs, government, and security forces.

6. Monitoring & Feedback Module
Functions:

Real-Time Tracking: Monitors the effectiveness of responses.

Feedback Loops: Incorporates lessons learned into system updates.

Impact Assessment: Evaluates whether interventions reduced risks.

7. Reporting & Visualization Module
Functions:

Dashboards: Displays real-time data via maps, graphs, and tables.

Automated Reports: Generates periodic summaries for policymakers.

Public Awareness: Shares non-sensitive findings with communities.

8. System Administration & Security Module
Functions:

User Access Control: Manages permissions for different stakeholders.

Data Encryption: Protects sensitive information.

System Maintenance: Ensures uptime and scalability.
