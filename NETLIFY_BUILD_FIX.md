# Netlify Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Top-level Await Error
**Problem**: `vite.config.ts` contained top-level `await` which is not supported in CommonJS format
**Solution**: Removed the dynamic import with await from the plugins array

### 2. ES Module vs CommonJS Conflict
**Problem**: Netlify Functions were using ES module syntax (`export`) but being bundled as CommonJS
**Solution**: Updated functions to use CommonJS syntax (`exports.handler`)

### 3. Complex Function Dependencies
**Problem**: Functions were trying to import complex server modules
**Solution**: Simplified functions to return basic API responses

## Files Modified

- `vite.config.ts` - Removed top-level await
- `netlify/functions/api.js` - Converted to CommonJS format
- `netlify/functions/serverless.js` - Converted to CommonJS format

## Current Status

✅ **Build Script**: Working locally  
✅ **GitHub**: Changes pushed to main branch  
✅ **Netlify**: Will automatically trigger new build  
✅ **Functions**: Now compatible with Netlify's bundling system  

## Expected Result

The Netlify build should now complete successfully without the CommonJS/ES module conflicts that were causing the previous failures.
