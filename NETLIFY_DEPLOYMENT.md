# Netlify Deployment Guide for Early Alert Network

## Manual Deployment Steps

Since the Netlify CLI is having issues, here's how to deploy manually:

### 1. Build the Application
The application has already been built successfully. The build output is in the `dist/` folder.

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Drag and Drop Deployment
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. Go to your dashboard
3. Drag and drop the `dist/` folder onto the deploy area
4. Your site will be deployed automatically

#### Option B: Git-based Deployment
1. Push your code to GitHub (already done)
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
3. Set the build command: `npx tsx scripts/build-for-netlify.js`
4. Set the publish directory: `dist`
5. Deploy

### 3. Environment Variables
In your Netlify dashboard, add these environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your Neon database connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: A random secret string
- Other API keys as needed

### 4. Functions
The `netlify/functions/` folder contains serverless functions for API endpoints.

## Build Output
- **Frontend**: `dist/public/` (React app)
- **Redirects**: `dist/_redirects` (SPA routing)
- **Headers**: `dist/_headers` (Security headers)
- **Functions**: `netlify/functions/` (API endpoints)

## Current Status
✅ Frontend built successfully
✅ Netlify configuration files created
✅ Serverless functions created
✅ Ready for deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the `dist/` folder to Netlify
2. Configure environment variables
3. Test the deployed application
