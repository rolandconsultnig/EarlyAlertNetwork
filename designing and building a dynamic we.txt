 designing and building a dynamic web application for the Nigeria Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Abuja Chapter. The application should serve as a comprehensive member portal and management system, streamlining operations, enhancing member engagement, and facilitating communication.

The application should be built with a modern, dynamic approach, leveraging a component-based architecture, custom hooks for reusable logic, and a state management solution (like React Query) for efficient data fetching.  Type safety with TypeScript is required, and the UI should be styled with Tailwind CSS, incorporating responsive design principles, toast notifications, and a tooltip system.

The backend should be robust and scalable, built with a Node.js server and a PostgreSQL database, with appropriate API routes, middleware for authentication and security, and a well-defined database schema. Database migrations and a separate file storage system should be implemented.

The application should encompass the following core modules and functionalities:

1. Authentication & User Management
